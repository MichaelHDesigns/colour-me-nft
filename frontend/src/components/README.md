# Component Architecture

This directory contains the modular component structure for the Paint dApp frontend.

## Core Components

- Title bar with icon and title
- Control buttons (minimize, maximize, close)
- Content area
- Responsive design

- Desktop navigation links
- Mobile hamburger menu

- Smooth scrolling to sections

### `ContextMenu`

- Configurable menu items

## Section Components

## Legacy Components

These components remain from the original structure and may benefit from future refactoring:
- `SVGDisplay` - Main canvas component
- `BlockchainControls` - Blockchain interaction controls
- `UnifiedActionButton` - Wallet connection and minting
- `TransactionQueue` - Transaction queue management
- `DebugPage` - Development debugging tools
- `ColourMe` - Main application logic

## CSS Architecture

Each component has its own CSS file co-located with the component:
- `OSWindow.css` - Window styling
- `Navigation.css` - Navigation styling
- `ContextMenu.css` - Context menu styling
- etc.

Global styles are in `/src/styles/global.css`.

## Usage

```tsx
// Import individual components
import { OSWindow, Navigation } from '../components';

// Import section components
import { AboutSection, HelpSection } from '../components/sections';

// Use with consistent props
<OSWindow title="My Window" icon="ðŸŽ¨" showControls={true}>
  <p>Window content</p>
</OSWindow>
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Modularity** - Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability** - Components can be used across different parts of the app
3. **Maintainability** - Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
4. **Testing** - Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Performance** - Smaller bundles through tree-shaking
6. **Developer Experience** - Consistent patterns and easier to onboard new developers
